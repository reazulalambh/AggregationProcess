# AggregationProcess

Here, Initially Large Number of particles of same size is present in a system. At each timestep, two particles are chosen randomly, their sizes are increased by some fraction alpha of their previous sizes, and then these two particles are added together to form a new particle. This process simulates the aggregation processes like solidification in nature. At different times, size distributions of particles are measured, and the distributions follow a power law with the sizes. Also, there is found a scaling relation among the distributions taken at different times.
